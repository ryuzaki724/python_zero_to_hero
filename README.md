# Part 1: Python Basics 🎯

## 1.1 Input and Output (I/O)

**Output** = Computer talking TO you (`print()`)
**Input** = Computer listening FROM you (`input()`)


```python
# OUTPUT - Using print()
print("Hello, World!")
print("Welcome to Python!")

# Print multiple things
print("My favorite number is", 7)

# F-strings (formatted strings)
name = "Alex"
age = 14
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.")
```

    Hello, World!
    Welcome to Python!
    My favorite number is 7
    My name is Alex and I am 14 years old.



```python
# INPUT - Getting info from user
# IMPORTANT: Enter a NUMBER when prompted!
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Nice to meet you, {user_name}!")

age_string = input("How old are you? (enter a number) ")
age_number = int(age_string)
print(f"In 10 years, you'll be {age_number + 10} years old!")
```

    Nice to meet you, Cora!
    In 10 years, you'll be 27 years old!


## 1.2 Variables and Constants

**Variables** = Labeled boxes that CAN change
**Constants** = Values that should NOT change (ALL CAPS)


```python
# VARIABLES - Can change!
score = 0
print(f"Starting score: {score}")

score = score + 10
print(f"After bonus: {score}")

score += 5  # Shorthand
print(f"After another bonus: {score}")

# Different data types
player_name = "SuperCoder"  # String
health = 100                # Integer
speed = 5.5                 # Float
is_alive = True             # Boolean

print(f"\nPlayer: {player_name}, Health: {health}, Speed: {speed}, Alive: {is_alive}")
```

    Starting score: 0
    After bonus: 10
    After another bonus: 15
    
    Player: SuperCoder, Health: 100, Speed: 5.5, Alive: True



```python
# CONSTANTS - Should NOT change (ALL CAPS)
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
MAX_PLAYERS = 10
GAME_TITLE = "Python Adventure"

print(f"PI = {PI}")
print(f"Gravity = {GRAVITY} m/s²")
print(f"Max Players = {MAX_PLAYERS}")

# Use constant in calculation
radius = 5
area = PI * radius * radius
print(f"\nCircle with radius {radius} has area {area:.2f}")
```

    PI = 3.14159
    Gravity = 9.8 m/s²
    Max Players = 10
    
    Circle with radius 5 has area 78.54


## 1.3 Data Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `int` | Whole numbers | `42`, `-7` |
| `float` | Decimals | `3.14`, `-0.5` |
| `str` | Text | `"Hello"` |
| `bool` | True/False | `True`, `False` |
| `None` | No value | `None` |


```python
# Exploring Data Types
my_int = 42
my_float = 3.14
my_string = "Hello Python!"
my_bool = True
my_none = None

# Use type() to check
print(f"{my_int} is type: {type(my_int)}")
print(f"{my_float} is type: {type(my_float)}")
print(f"{my_string} is type: {type(my_string)}")
print(f"{my_bool} is type: {type(my_bool)}")
print(f"{my_none} is type: {type(my_none)}")
```

    42 is type: <class 'int'>
    3.14 is type: <class 'float'>
    Hello Python! is type: <class 'str'>
    True is type: <class 'bool'>
    None is type: <class 'NoneType'>



```python
# Type Conversion (Casting)
text_number = "123"
real_number = int(text_number)
print(f"'{text_number}' + 1 = {real_number + 1}")

age = 14
age_text = str(age)
print(f"I am " + age_text + " years old")

price = 19.99
whole_price = int(price)  # Removes decimal
print(f"${price} rounded down is ${whole_price}")
```

    '123' + 1 = 124
    I am 14 years old
    $19.99 rounded down is $19

# Part 2: Data Structures 📦

## 2.1 Lists
An ordered collection you CAN modify. Like a shopping list!


```python
# Creating Lists
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = ["hello", 42, 3.14, True]

print("Fruits:", fruits)
print("Numbers:", numbers)

# Accessing by INDEX (starts at 0!)
print(f"\nFirst fruit: {fruits[0]}")
print(f"Last fruit: {fruits[-1]}")  # Negative = from end
```

    Fruits: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    Numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    
    First fruit: apple
    Last fruit: cherry



```python
# Modifying Lists
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
print("Original:", colors)

colors.append("yellow")      # Add to end
print("After append:", colors)

colors.insert(1, "orange")   # Insert at position
print("After insert:", colors)

colors.remove("green")       # Remove by value
print("After remove:", colors)

popped = colors.pop()        # Remove & return last
print(f"Popped: {popped}, Now: {colors}")

colors[0] = "purple"         # Change item
print("After change:", colors)

print(f"\nLength: {len(colors)}")
```

    Original: ['red', 'green', 'blue']
    After append: ['red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']
    After insert: ['red', 'orange', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow']
    After remove: ['red', 'orange', 'blue', 'yellow']
    Popped: yellow, Now: ['red', 'orange', 'blue']
    After change: ['purple', 'orange', 'blue']
    
    Length: 3



```python
# Looping through Lists
games = ["Minecraft", "Fortnite", "Roblox", "Among Us"]

print("My favorite games:")
for game in games:
    print(f"  - {game}")

# With index using enumerate()
print("\nWith rankings:")
for index, game in enumerate(games, start=1):
    print(f"  #{index}: {game}")

# Slicing
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(f"\nFirst 3: {numbers[:3]}")
print(f"Last 3: {numbers[-3:]}")
print(f"Middle: {numbers[3:7]}")
```

    My favorite games:
      - Minecraft
      - Fortnite
      - Roblox
      - Among Us
    
    With rankings:
      #1: Minecraft
      #2: Fortnite
      #3: Roblox
      #4: Among Us
    
    First 3: [0, 1, 2]
    Last 3: [7, 8, 9]
    Middle: [3, 4, 5, 6]


## 2.2 Tuples
Like lists but CANNOT modify after creation. "Immutable". Good for coordinates, RGB colors.


```python
# Creating Tuples - use parentheses ()
coordinates = (10, 20)
rgb_red = (255, 0, 0)
person = ("Alice", 14, "9th Grade")

print(f"Coordinates: {coordinates}")
print(f"Red RGB: {rgb_red}")
print(f"Person: {person}")

# Accessing items
print(f"\nX: {coordinates[0]}, Y: {coordinates[1]}")

# Tuple unpacking
x, y = coordinates
name, age, grade = person
print(f"\nUnpacked: x={x}, y={y}")
print(f"{name} is {age} years old in {grade}")
```

    Coordinates: (10, 20)
    Red RGB: (255, 0, 0)
    Person: ('Alice', 14, '9th Grade')
    
    X: 10, Y: 20
    
    Unpacked: x=10, y=20
    Alice is 14 years old in 9th Grade


## 2.3 Dictionaries
Stores **key-value pairs**. Like a real dictionary: key = word, value = definition.


```python
# Creating Dictionaries - use curly braces {}
student = {
    "name": "Alex",
    "age": 14,
    "grade": 9,
    "gpa": 3.8
}

print("Student:", student)

# Accessing by KEY
print(f"\nName: {student['name']}")
print(f"GPA: {student['gpa']}")

# Using .get() is safer
print(f"Color: {student.get('color', 'Not specified')}")
```

    Student: {'name': 'Alex', 'age': 14, 'grade': 9, 'gpa': 3.8}
    
    Name: Alex
    GPA: 3.8
    Color: Not specified



```python
# Looping through Dictionaries
grades = {"Math": 95, "English": 88, "Science": 92, "History": 85}

print("Report Card:")
for subject, score in grades.items():
    status = "Pass" if score >= 60 else "Fail"
    print(f"  {subject}: {score} ({status})")

average = sum(grades.values()) / len(grades)
print(f"\nAverage: {average:.1f}")
```

    Report Card:
      Math: 95 (Pass)
      English: 88 (Pass)
      Science: 92 (Pass)
      History: 85 (Pass)
    
    Average: 90.0

```python
def add(a, b):
    """
    Add two numbers together and return the sum.
    
    This function demonstrates a function with multiple parameters
    and a return value that can be used in further calculations.
    
    Parameters:
        a (int or float): The first number to add. Can be any numeric type
            that supports the addition operation.

            that supports the addition operation.
    
    Returns:
        int or float: The sum of a and b. The return type matches the
            input types (int + int = int, float involved = float).
    
    Example:
        >>> result = add(5, 3)
        >>> print(result)
        8
    """
    result = a + b
    return result

sum_result = add(5, 3)
print(f"5 + 3 = {sum_result}")
```

    5 + 3 = 8



```python
def power(base, exponent=2):
    """
    Raise a base number to a given exponent power.
    
    This function demonstrates default parameter values. If no exponent
    is provided, it defaults to 2 (squaring the base).
    
    Parameters:
        base (int or float): The base number to be raised to a power.
            This is the number that will be multiplied by itself.
        exponent (int or float, optional): The power to raise the base to.

    Returns:
        int or float: The result of base raised to the exponent power.
            Calculated as base ** exponent.
    
    Example:
        >>> power(3)       # 3 squared = 9
        9
        >>> power(2, 10)   # 2 to the 10th = 1024
        1024
    """
    return base ** exponent

print(f"3 squared: {power(3)}")
print(f"3 cubed: {power(3, 3)}")
print(f"2 to the 10th: {power(2, 10)}")
```

    3 squared: 9
    3 cubed: 27
    2 to the 10th: 1024



```python
def get_min_max(numbers):
    """
    Find and return both the minimum and maximum values in a list.
    
    This function demonstrates returning multiple values from a function

```

    List: [4, 1, 9, 2, 7, 3]
    Min: 1, Max: 9


## 3.2 Classes and Objects 🏗️

A **class** is a blueprint. An **object** is built from that blueprint.
- Class = Blueprint for a house
- Object = An actual house

Classes bundle **data** (attributes) and **behavior** (methods) together!


```python
class Dog:
    """
    A class representing a dog with attributes and behaviors.
    
    This class demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts including
    instance attributes, methods, and state management. Each Dog instance
    has its own name, breed, age, and energy level.
    
    Attributes:
        name (str): The dog's name, set during initialization.
        breed (str): The dog's breed (e.g., "Golden Retriever").
        age (int): The dog's age in years.
        energy (int): The dog's current energy level, ranging from 0 to 100.
            Starts at 100 and decreases when playing.
    
    Example:
        >>> my_dog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever", 3)
        >>> my_dog.bark()
        Buddy says: Woof! Woof!

# Part 4: Neural Network from Scratch! 🧠

## How Neural Networks Learn:
1. **Forward Pass** - Data goes through, makes predictions
2. **Loss Calculation** - Measure how wrong we are
3. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)** - Calculate how to fix weights
4. **Optimization** - Actually update the weights


```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```python
def sigmoid(x):
    """
    Sigmoid activation function that squishes any number to range (0, 1).
    
    The sigmoid function is one of the most common activation functions
    in neural networks. It's especially useful for binary classification
    because it outputs values that can be interpreted as probabilities.
    
    Parameters:
        x (numpy.ndarray or float): Input value(s) to apply sigmoid to.
            Can be a single number or an array of any shape.
    
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray or float: Output value(s) in the range (0, 1).
            Large positive inputs close to 1
            Large negative inputs close to 0
            Zero exactly 0.5
    
    Formula:
        sigmoid(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x))
    
    Example:
        >>> sigmoid(0)
        0.5

    Compute the derivative of the sigmoid function.
    
    This derivative is essential for backpropagation, as it tells us
    how much the sigmoid output changes when the input changes.
    The derivative has a nice property: it can be computed from
    the sigmoid output itself.
    
    Parameters:
        x (numpy.ndarray or float): Input value(s) to compute derivative at.
    
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray or float: The gradient/derivative of sigmoid at x.
            Maximum value of 0.25 occurs at x=0.
    
    Formula:
